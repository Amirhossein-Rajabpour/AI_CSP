# Constraint Satisfaction Problems
Artificial Intelligence Course 3rd Project: Implementing CSP Backtracking, Forward Checking and MAC Algorithms in order to solve a binary puzzle.

In this group project we ([arminZolfaghari](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari) and [Amirhossein-Rajabpour](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour)) solved a binary puzzle using `CSP`.<br>
<br>
You can specify to use `forward checking` or `MAC` algorithm in `main.py` file. 

Puzzle rules are as follows:
> 1. Number of 1's and 0's in each row and column must be equal
> 2. Each row and column must be unique 
> 3. There should be no more than two duplicates in each row and column.

You can choose puzzle in `main.py` file and puzzle should be like sample input bellow
